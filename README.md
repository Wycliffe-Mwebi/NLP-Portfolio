| 1 | PRE-PROCESSING TEXT DATA -How to prepare text data for machine learning   | Machines cannot understand English or any text data by default. The text data needs a special preparation before you can give it to the machine to predict something out of it. In this project, I will practically go through all the required steps such as removing stops words, correcting spelling mistakes, removing meaningless words, removing rare words and many more.   | [Link](https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/NLP-Portfolio/tree/main/01-PRE-PROCESSING%20TEXT%20DATA)  |

In this project, I will create an NLP machine learning model to predict if a new incoming Amazon customer review is positive or negative.  | [Link](https://github.com/Wycliffe-Mwebi/NLP-Portfolio/tree/main/SENTIMENT%20ANALYSIS%20-Amazon%20Customer)   |
