    "# Parts of Speech(POS) Tagging & Chunking in NLTK Python\n",
    "### What is POS Tagging?\n",
    "POS Tagging is the process of tagging words in a sentence with corresponding parts of speech like noun, pronoun, verb, adverb, preposition, etc.\n",
    "Tagging the words of a text with parts of speech helps to understand how does the word functions grammatically in the context of the sentence. A word can assume different parts of speech depending on the context of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "POS Tagging is useful in sentence parsing, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, etc. In fact, it is a prerequisite for the process of Chunking and Named Entity Recognition in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POS Tagging in NLTK Library\n",
    "POS Tagging in NLTK library is done using pos_tag() function which takes the tokens of a sentence as input and it returns the POS tag for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List of POS Tags in NLTK\n",
    "Usually, in schools, we are taught about 9 different types of parts of speech â€“ noun, verb, adverb, article, preposition, pronoun, adjective, conjunction, and interjection. But NLTK actually provides many categories and sub-categories of tags than just the traditional nine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate all the available POS tags by using nltk.help.upenn_tagset() function."
