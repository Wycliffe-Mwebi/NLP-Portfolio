# Daily News Sentiment Analysis
This project attempts to analyze the daily news we are subjected to and tries to investigate the sentiments 
associated with the news articles. It also tries to investigate if there is a perticular trend in the way the 
major publishishers from around the world report stories?

We try and investigate the sentiments associated with the news articles to answer the following questions

- Is the Media focussing too much on the negative side of the story? Do the negative news dominate the headlines ?
- Is there a perticular trend in the way the major publishishers from around the world report stories?
- Do the word distribution in news articles picked up randomly follow the zipf's law?
