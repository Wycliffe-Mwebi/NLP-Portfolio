Sentiment Analysis is also known as Opinion mining. With the help of Sentiment Analysis, we humans can determine whether the text is showing positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis can help in reducing churn, increase sales of a product, create brand awareness and to analyze the reviews of customers inorder to improve your products.
